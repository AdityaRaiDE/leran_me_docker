1. virtualization vs hypervisor vs docker
   --> [hardware]-->[os]-->[virtualization software like virtualbox/vmware]-> [VMss]
   --> [hardware]-->[hypervisor]--> [VMsss]
   --> [hardware]-->[host os] --> [docker software] -->[Containers] (lightweight virtualization is achived]
   --> one is software and another is hardware component
   --> if we install 2 o.s then on boot time either one of os we can use 
   --> in canse of virtualization software if host os is corrupt then we cannot access vms
   --> hypervisor is directly installed on software 
   --> vm will have complete os and required max of unwanted resources, in vms , kernals , binaries are also gets installed
2. docker is opensource software used for containerlization process .containers are created from docker images .
3. containers uses host kernals and only we need binaries ( if we want to run python then we just need python binaries)
4. images are blueprint to create container.
5. [hardware]-->[os]->[docker]->[binaries/libray]--> [application]
6. virtualization is heavy duty virtualization and docker is called light weight virtualization
7. vms gets created from iso.
8. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly(running instance of image)
9. via docker we can achive microservices model too.
10. docker --version (to find if docker is installed or not)
